# Password-Strength-Assessment-Tool
This is a Python program that assesses the strength of a password based on various criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The program provides feedback to the user on the password's strength and suggests improvements if needed.

## Example
```bash
Enter a password to check its strength: Juhi@1s
Password Strength: Strong
- Password should be at least 8 characters long.
Would you like to check another password? (yes/no): Juhi121@singhj
```
